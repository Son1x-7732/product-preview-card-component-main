## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned the use of variable css class for efficiently handling color and font throughout the project.

- The need of visually hidden elements in html for better reader accessibility.

### Useful resources

- [My only resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2WL6KkqhLQ) - This is a comprehensive video guide by Kevin Powell. I learned how to properly approach a project firsthand and will continue using it in future challenges and projects. I recommend to watch his videos for great insight in CSS.
